# Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Challenge
return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
I knew I would need a for loop to iterate over the array. 
For Big 0, i still don't really understand it so I referred to: https://www.interviewcake.com/article/java/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity - should be O(1) - because it requires one step.

needed help with syntax so I looked through stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2137755/how-do-i-reverse-an-int-array-in-java
