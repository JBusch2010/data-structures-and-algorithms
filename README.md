#Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

**Challenge
return an array with elements in reversed order.

**Approach & Efficiency
I knew I would need a for loop to iterate over the array. For Big 0, i still don't really understand it so I referred to: https://www.interviewcake.com/article/java/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity - should be O(1) - because it requires one step.

**Solution
reversearray

**Credits
the reading for Day 2 where I chose to go with a regular for loop: https://www.baeldung.com/java-loops

needed help with syntax so I looked through stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2137755/how-do-i-reverse-an-int-array-in-java

along with: https://www.java67.com/2016/10/3-ways-to-reverse-array-in-java-coding-interview-question.html

#ArrayShift
Write a function that takes in an array and the value to be added then return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

**Challenge
return an array with value added at the middle index

**Approach & Efficiency
I knew I needed to create an array, insert the new value in the array at a certain index,and then return the array. I found and learned a way to obtain the solution to the problem
