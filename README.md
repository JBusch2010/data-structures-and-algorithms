### 1. Reverse an Array

#### Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

#### Approach & Efficiency
I knew I would need a for loop to iterate over the array. For Big 0, i still don't really understand it so I referred to: https://www.interviewcake.com/article/java/big-o-notation-time-and-space-complexity - should be O(1) - because it requires one step.

### 2. Insert and shift an array in middle at index

#### Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

#### Approach & Efficiency
I knew I needed to create an array, insert the new value in the array at a certain index,and then return the array. I found and learned a way to obtain the solution to the problem.

### 3. Binary search in a sorted 1D array

#### Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

#### Approach & Efficiency
Continue to check if the key is larger, smaller, or the same.  If the element does not exist the method will return -1;
